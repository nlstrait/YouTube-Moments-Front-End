# YouTube Moments - Front End
YouTube Moments allows you to resurface memorable moments from your liked YouTube videos. If you love listening to long-form podcasts, interviews, and lectures, but forget where you heard that genius comment, YouTube Moments empowers your search. By digesting the transcripts of your liked videos, YouTube Moments enables you to search semantically by phrase, synonym, and broad category. No more vague keyword searches that only lead to click-baity titles and still 3 hours of video to scrub through. Find the exact moment you are looking for.

## Technology
This front end for YouTube Moments is built using Vue.js. The back end uses Python and Django. I plan to eventually deployed a server for public use, but for now, enjoy a preview of what the front end will look like (demo link above).

The back end repo can be found here: https://github.com/nlstrait/YouTube-Moments-BackEnd
